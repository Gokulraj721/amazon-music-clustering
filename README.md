# 🎧 Amazon Music Clustering

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to group Amazon Music tracks based on audio features like energy, danceability, and valence.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
With millions of songs, manual genre tagging is impractical. This project clusters songs by sound to uncover genre-like groupings.

## 📦 Features Used
- danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms

## 🧠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Scaling
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method
- PCA Visualization
- Cluster Profiling
- Streamlit Dashboard

## 📊 Deliverables
- `eda.ipynb`: Full preprocessing and clustering pipeline
- `streamlit_app.py`: Interactive dashboard
- `clustered_music_data.csv`: Final dataset with cluster labels

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
